# 🛕 Blockchain-Based Fund Management System for Indian Temples
**🔐 A secure and transparent platform to manage temple donations using blockchain technology.**

## 📝Description
A secure and transparent web-based platform for managing temple donations using blockchain technology. The system ensures real-time tracking, fraud prevention, and trust-building among donors and temple authorities.
Temples in India receive significant donations, which are often managed through opaque and centralized systems. This can lead to mismanagement and loss of public trust. Blockchain offers a transparent, decentralized, and tamper-proof solution.
By recording each transaction on the blockchain, donations become traceable and verifiable in real time. Smart contracts enable automated, rule-based fund distribution, minimizing human errors and reducing the risk of corruption.
